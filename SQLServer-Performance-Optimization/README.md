# SQL Server Performance Optimization Project 1

## ðŸ§© Overview
This project demonstrates how indexing and query optimization can dramatically improve performance in SQL Server.  
A financial institutionâ€™s core banking application was slowed down due to a full table scan on a large transaction table.  

## ðŸš€ Goal
Optimize the query by analyzing the execution plan and adding an appropriate index.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Query Execution Plans
- DMVs

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 1_Create_Schema.sql | Creates the Transactions table and sample data |
| 2_Slow_Query.sql | Slow-performing query |
| 3_Create_Index.sql | Index creation for optimization |
| 4_Optimized_Query.sql | Improved version of the query |
| Problem_Statement.md | Describes the real-world issue |
| Report | Contains detailed report and screenshots |

## âš¡ Results
- Query execution time reduced from several seconds to milliseconds.
- Logical reads and CPU usage significantly dropped.
- Improved transaction processing performance.
